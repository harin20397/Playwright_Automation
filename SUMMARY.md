Key Features:
-------------
1. Page Object Model implementation for maintainable test code
2. Comprehensive authentication flow testing
3. Profile management testing including personal and contact information
4. Positive and negative test cases
5. Configuration management for different environments
6. Helper functions for common testing tasks
7. Detailed reporting and screenshot capture on test failures

Test Coverage:
--------------
Authentication Tests:
- Successful login with valid credentials
- Unsuccessful login with invalid credentials
- Unsuccessful login with empty credentials
- Unsuccessful login with empty email
- Unsuccessful login with empty password

Profile Tests:
- View profile page
- Update personal information
- Update contact information
- Update personal information with empty fields
- Update personal information with invalid email

Setup Instructions:
-------------------
1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Install Playwright browsers: npx playwright install
3. Run tests: npm test
4. Run specific test suites:
   - Authentication tests: npm run test:auth
   - Profile tests: npm run test:profile
5. Run tests in UI mode: npm run test:ui
6. View test report: npm run test:report

The framework is designed to be easily extensible for additional test scenarios and follows best practices for test automation.
